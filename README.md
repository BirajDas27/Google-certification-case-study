## 🧹 Step 2: Data Processing
Key processing steps performed:

- Created `ride_length` and converted it into a **time-based format**
- Added `day_of_week` for behavioral analysis (1 => Sunday, 7 => Saturday)
- Validated critical fields and retained relevant records
- Removed rides with negative or zero duration
- Replaced blank values with `NA`
- Ensured member types are consistent (member, casual)
